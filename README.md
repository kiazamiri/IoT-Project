# Designing and Implementing a Wifi/GPRS gateway for IoT
## Abstract
One of technologies that has been the focus of many people around the world in recent years is **Internet of Things** (IoT). The concept of IoT can be explained as a world that everything in it including inanimate objects have a digital identity. This novel technology has many interesting and various applications that expand from a simple smartphone connection to a home device to complex tasks like smart cities and power management. 

In this repository, I try to familiarize and deepen your knowledge about this technology and its applications. Then I will explain a new branch of this tech called **Narrowband IoT**, which has more benefits compared to its predecessors. Lastly, I will show you how to build a GPRS gateway to a data server.
## Internet of Things
Iot points to the connection between objects and their environment with the internet and our ability to control and manage them with applications on our smartphone and tablets. In simple terms, IoT is the network between sensors and machines, which can communicate with each other and their users. Experts have predicted that in next year (2020) their will be nearly 30 billion objects that are connected to the Internet

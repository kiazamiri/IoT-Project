# Designing and Implementing a Wifi/GPRS gateway for IoT
## Abstract
One of technologies that has been the focus of many people around the world in recent years is **Internet of Things** (IoT). The concept of IoT can be explained as a world that everything in it including inanimate objects have a digital identity. This novel technology has many interesting and various applications that expand from a simple smartphone connection to a home device to complex tasks like smart cities and power management. 

In this repository, I try to familiarize and deepen your knowledge about this technology and its applications. Then I will explain a new branch of this tech called Narrowband IoT, which has more benefits compared to its predecessors. Lastly, I will show you how to build a GPRS gateway to a data server.
